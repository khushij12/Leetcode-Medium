- to get revision of the entites that we previously got
- T1
- T2 E11[5], E12[4], E13[3]
- T3 E


why revisionInfoEntity is not there?
when to paginate?
how we know that page will not be more than 2nd page
why pageSize is not provided further in GithubIssueEntity
//How we will sure that this page includes all details till maxtime
criteriaDialect is not implemented. Good?
sendReadRequestWithoutPagination will typereference work?
HierachyProcess
will we have read only values.
i havent used change log and its related implementation in JirestPoller -> getRevisionInfoCarrierForCreateEvent.Is it fine?
- mentioned -> subscribed
- How to decide which exception to throw?
- why different user are required for integration and user like in poller -> getRevisionInfoCarrierForCreateEvent
- difference between criteriaBuilder and queryBuilder
- revisionId = 0 ?
- getFieldsCarrierListForUpdateEvent is left.
- Attachment field is not there
- why we dont need adapter?
- we are not supporting organization?
